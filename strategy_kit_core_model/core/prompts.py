## Output Format:
Start your summary with a friendly, personalized greeting that addresses the relevant team or audience. Use this format:

"Hey [Report Title/Topic] team! We wanted to create this quick audio summary to walk you through the key findings from our recent report..."

Then provide the main content as a clean, well-punctuated summary that flows naturally when read aloud. The summary should capture the essence of the report while being concise enough for quick audio consumption.

End with a friendly closing that encourages action or follow-up if appropriate. Match the closing tone to the overall content - celebratory for good news, supportive and forward-looking for challenges.

**Example phrases for different emotional contexts:**
- **Positive news:** "Exciting developments!", "Outstanding work!", "This is fantastic!"
- **Challenging news:** "This requires our attention...", "We're facing some hurdles...", "Let's tackle this together..."
- **Mixed results:** "We have some wins to celebrate and some areas to focus on..."
