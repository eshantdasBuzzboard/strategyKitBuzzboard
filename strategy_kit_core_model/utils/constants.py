Here’s a detailed summary of the key points, analysis, and important details from the document:

Pumpkin Porters’ marketing progress from June to August 2025 shows significant growth in social media visibility and engagement, especially on Instagram. The brand has been consistently posting and running Facebook Ads, which have expanded in volume. However, the report notes that Facebook Ads now require fresh creatives to control the cost per click (CPC) and recover the efficiency seen in July.

**Big Wins and Key Metrics:**
- Instagram impressions increased dramatically from 60 in July to 389 in August, a 548% growth.
- Facebook posts increased from 5 in June to 11 in August, also a 548% growth.
- Facebook Ads delivered 469 clicks at a 12.14% click-through rate (CTR) in July, with an efficient CPC of $0.31 in August, representing a 110% increase in clicks.
- The brand maintained a 100% review response rate, which is crucial for building trust with the local audience.

**Initial Strategy Commitments:**
- The initial strategy set follower and engagement targets for both Facebook and Instagram, with a $50 ad spend on Facebook and Google. The goal was to build early visibility and attract local customers.
- For Facebook, the target was to grow from 0 to 50–70 followers over 12 months. For Instagram, the target was 18–30 followers in the same period.
- The report emphasizes that followers are considered meaningful local leads, likely to convert into customers.

**Content and Campaign Delivery:**
- Ongoing and on-demand posts were published to boost brand visibility and engagement, including seasonal promotions and new ad creatives.
- Two Facebook ad campaigns were launched to drive engagement and visibility.
- The timeline of content delivery includes initial campaign content in June, brand voice highlights in July, and engagement-focused posts and new ad creatives in August.

**Growth Analysis:**
- Instagram was the strongest growth driver, with impressions rising from 60 to 389.
- Facebook Ads delivered engagement but need refreshed creatives to reduce CPC and lift CTR back above 12%.
- Facebook impressions dropped from 2,235 in July to 77 in August, a 67% decrease, indicating the need for new ad content.

- The CTR for Facebook Ads was 10.15% in August, down from 12.14% in July, but still considered strong.
- Google Ads were not active in August; only organic search and maps visibility contributed, resulting in three site clicks. The report notes that Google Ads remain a missed opportunity until reactivated.

**September Game Plan:**
- Instagram: Submit on-demand requests for seasonal content to lift reach to over 500 impressions. Posts will focus on event highlights and specials.
- Google Ads: Relaunch local keyword campaigns with a goal of generating 150+ clicks. This requires confirming the budget and creating new ads.
